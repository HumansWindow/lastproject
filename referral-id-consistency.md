# Referral Module ID Consistency Analysis

## Findings

After analyzing the referral module files, I've found that:

1. **ID Field Usage**: The module consistently uses:
   - `id` as the primary key field name in all entities
   - `userId` as foreign key to users
   - `referrerId` and `referredId` as specific user relationship identifiers
   
2. **Request User Access**: The controller properly uses `req.user.id` for accessing the authenticated user ID throughout.

3. **Database Queries**: The service consistently uses:
   - `where: { id }` for primary key queries
   - `where: { userId }` for user relationship queries
   - `where: { referrerId }` and `where: { referredId }` for specific relationships

4. **Entity Relationships**: Proper foreign key naming with suffixed IDs (e.g., `userId`, `referrerId`, `referredId`)

## Recommendations

The referral module has **excellent ID field consistency** and aligns with our established guidelines:

1. **Keep Current Patterns**: The module should maintain its consistent use of:
   - `id` for primary keys
   - `userId` for general user foreign keys
   - `referrerId`/`referredId` for specific relationship fields

2. **Documentation**: Add comments to explain the relationship between:
   - `referrerId` and `userId`
   - `referredId` and `userId`

3. **Consider TypeORM Relations**: For enhanced type safety, consider adding explicit TypeORM relation decorators:
   ```typescript
   @ManyToOne(() => User)
   @JoinColumn({ name: 'userId' })
   user: User;
   
   @ManyToOne(() => User)
   @JoinColumn({ name: 'referrerId' })
   referrer: User;
   
   @ManyToOne(() => User)
   @JoinColumn({ name: 'referredId' })
   referred: User;
   ```

## Conclusion

The referral module is a model of good practice for ID field consistency. Other modules should follow similar patterns for standardization across the codebase.
