# Wallet Authentication Implementation Checklist

## Immediate Fixes

### Frontend (Already Fixed)
- [x] Add debouncing to WalletConnectButton using useRef to track authentication attempts
- [x] Simplify useEffect dependency arrays in WalletConnectButton
- [x] Add cleanup functions to prevent memory leaks with authentication timeouts
- [x] Implement better error handling to recover from failed authentication attempts
- [x] Use useCallback for performAuthentication to prevent unnecessary re-renders

### Backend (To Be Implemented)
- [ ] Implement challenge cache in WalletAuthController to track issued challenges
- [ ] Add request deduplication in WalletAuthController's connect method
- [ ] Improve transaction handling in AuthService.walletLogin for atomic operations
- [ ] Add wallet address normalization consistently across all methods
- [ ] Update error handling to properly roll back partial user/wallet creation
- [ ] Add request tracking IDs to correlate frontend/backend logs

### Testing
- [ ] Test WalletConnectButton to ensure single connection request
- [ ] Verify user creation works properly with the improved flow
- [ ] Test error scenarios (invalid signature, timeout, etc.)
- [ ] Monitor logs to ensure no duplicate connection requests

## How to Test

### Frontend Testing
1. Open browser dev tools and monitor network requests
2. Click on the WalletConnectButton
3. Verify only one request is sent to `/auth/wallet/connect`
4. Complete the wallet signature process
5. Verify only one request is sent to `/auth/wallet/authenticate`

### Backend Testing
1. Monitor backend logs during wallet connection attempts
2. Verify no duplicate "Wallet connection request received" messages for the same address
3. Check user creation in database to ensure no duplicate users/wallets
4. Test error recovery by simulating failures at different points in the flow

## Implementation Notes

### For Frontend
- The main issue was in the WalletConnectButton component's useEffect dependency array
- Adding proper state tracking with useRef prevents reconnection loops
- Using useCallback properly memoizes functions to prevent unnecessary effect triggers
- Adding timeout cleanup prevents stale authentication attempts

### For Backend
- Focus on making wallet connection and user creation transactional
- Add proper checks for duplicate challenges based on wallet address
- Consider adding a short-term cache (Redis or in-memory) for challenge tracking
- Ensure wallet addresses are consistently normalized to lowercase
- Add proper error classification for better frontend error handling
