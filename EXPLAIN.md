# AliveHuman Backend - Architecture and Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive explanation of the backend architecture, components, and technical implementation.

## Backend Architecture (NestJS)

## SHAHI Coin Minting System

### System Overview

The SHAHI Coin system is an ERC-20 token implementation with unique features designed for the AliveHuman ecosystem:
- First-time minting: Users can mint tokens once after account verification
- Annual minting: Users can mint additional tokens once per year
- Staking system: Different lock periods offer variable APY rewards
- Security features: Device binding, fraud prevention, and expiration mechanisms
- Token economics: Controlled burn rate and supply management

### Smart Contract Components

1. **`/backend/src/blockchain/contracts/SHAHICoin.sol`**

### Backend Service Components

1. **`/backend/src/blockchain/services/shahi-token.service.ts`**
   - Core service for interacting with the SHAHI contract
   - Initializes connection to the blockchain using HotWallet
   - Connects to the SHAHI contract using ethers.js
   - Implements signature generation for secure minting
   - Provides methods for both first-time and annual minting
   - Monitors token balances and statistics
   - Sets up event listeners for minting and expiration events
   - Implements token expiration handling and burning

2. **`/backend/src/blockchain/services/merkle.service.ts`**
   - Generates and manages Merkle trees for secure user verification
   - Pulls verified users from database to create dynamic whitelist
   - Generates Merkle root to be set in the smart contract
   - Creates and verifies Merkle proofs for secure minting eligibility
   - Updates Merkle tree when new users get verified
   - Ensures secure verification without storing sensitive data on-chain

3. **`/backend/src/blockchain/services/minting.service.ts`**
   - High-level service that orchestrates the minting process
   - Integrates device detection for anti-fraud measures
   - Coordinates between user requests and token service
   - Verifies user eligibility via Merkle proofs
   - Processes both first-time and annual minting requests
   - Routes minting requests to the token service with proper security checks

### Controllers and API Endpoints

1. **`/backend/src/blockchain/controllers/minting.controller.ts`**
   - Exposes REST API endpoints for token minting
   - Implements JWT authentication for secure access
   - Enforces rate limiting for minting requests
   - Provides endpoints for both first-time and annual minting

### Scheduled Tasks

1. **`/backend/src/blockchain/tasks/token-expiry.task.ts`**
   - Scheduled NestJS task running at midnight daily
   - Checks all user wallets for expired SHAHI tokens
   - Calls the burnExpiredTokens function on the contract
   - Implements error handling and logging for failed operations
   - Maintains token supply dynamics through systematic burning
   - Integrates with the TypeORM repository to get all wallet addresses

### Integration Components

   - WebSocket gateway for real-time token event notifications
   - Implements secure authentication for WebSocket connections
   - Listens for events from the token service
   - Broadcasts minting events to connected clients
   - Notifies users about token expiration events
   - Creates a namespace for token-specific events

2. **`/backend/src/blockchain/blockchain.module.ts`**
   - NestJS module that ties together all blockchain components
   - Imports and configures TypeORM repositories
   - Registers all services as providers
   - Configures event emitter for token notifications

   - WebSocket authentication guard for secure WebSocket connections
   - Validates JWT tokens for real-time event subscriptions
   - Rejects unauthorized connection attempts
   - Adds user information to WebSocket connection context

### Security Considerations

1. **Device Binding**
   - Each minting operation is tied to a specific device through device fingerprinting
   - Device IDs are generated based on user agent and IP address
   - Prevents users from claiming multiple tokens from different devices
   - Stored on-chain as a hashed value to prevent replay attacks

2. **Merkle Proof Verification**
   - First-time minting requires a valid Merkle proof
   - Only verified users in the Merkle tree can mint tokens
   - Admin can update the Merkle root to add new eligible users
   - Cryptographically secure verification without exposing user lists

3. **Signature Verification**
   - Annual minting requires a valid signature from an authorized minter
   - Signatures include user address, device ID, and timestamp
   - Prevents forgery and unauthorized minting attempts
   - Signatures are verified on-chain for maximum security

4. **Rate Limiting**
   - API endpoints implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
   - Limits are configured per user and IP address
   - Flexible rate limiting parameters controllable via environment variables
   - Helps prevent denial-of-service attacks on the minting system

5. **Token Expiration**
   - Minted tokens expire after one year if not used in the ecosystem
   - Daily scheduled task checks and burns expired tokens
   - Maintains healthy token economics and circulation
   - Encourages active participation in the ecosystem
