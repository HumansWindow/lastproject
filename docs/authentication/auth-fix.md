# Wallet Authentication Debugging and Fixing Guide

## Objective
This document outlines the steps to debug and fix wallet authentication issues in a new session. It includes testing the backend, verifying the frontend integration, and ensuring seamless wallet authentication.

## Steps to Debug and Fix Wallet Authentication

### 1. Verify Backend Functionality
- **Ensure Backend is Running**:
  - Run the following command to check the backend health:
    ```bash
    curl http://localhost:3001/health
    ```
  - Confirm that the backend is operational and responding.

- **Test Authentication Endpoints**:
  - Use the provided test script to verify the `/auth/wallet/authenticate` and `/auth/wallet-debug/mock-authenticate` endpoints.
  - Run the test script:
    ```bash
    cd /home/alivegod/Desktop/4-Ordibehesht/LastProjectendpoint/LastProject/scripts/auth
    node test-wallet-auth.js
    ```
  - Check the logs for successful authentication and debug any errors.

---

### 2. Debug Frontend Integration
- **Inspect Frontend Payload**:
  - Ensure the frontend sends the correct payload to the `/auth/wallet/authenticate` endpoint.
  - Verify that the payload includes:
    - `address`
    - `walletAddress`
    - `signature`
    - `message`

- **Use Browser Developer Tools**:
  - Open the browser's developer tools.
  - Monitor the network tab to inspect the requests and responses during wallet authentication.

- **Add Logging**:
  - Add detailed logging in the frontend code to debug the wallet connection and authentication flow.

---

### 3. Handle Edge Cases
- **Expired Challenges**:
  - Ensure the frontend handles expired challenges gracefully by requesting a new challenge.

- **Invalid Signatures**:
  - Add error handling for invalid or empty signatures.

- **Rate Limits**:
  - Implement retry logic with exponential backoff to handle rate-limiting errors.

---

### 4. Test the Complete Flow
- **Simulate Wallet Authentication**:
  - Test the wallet authentication flow end-to-end in the frontend.
  - Verify that the user can connect their wallet, sign the challenge, and authenticate successfully.

- **Check Tokens**:
  - Ensure that the access token and refresh token are received and stored securely.

---

### 5. Document Findings
- **Log Errors and Fixes**:
  - Document any errors encountered and the steps taken to fix them.

- **Update Codebase**:
  - Commit the fixes to the codebase with clear commit messages.

---

## Notes
- Use the `test-wallet-auth.js` script as a reference for constructing the authentication payload.
- Ensure that the backend and frontend are synchronized in terms of API contracts and payload structure.

## Conclusion
Following these steps will help debug and fix wallet authentication issues effectively. Ensure thorough testing and documentation to maintain a robust authentication flow.
