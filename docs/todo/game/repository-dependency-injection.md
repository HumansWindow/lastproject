# Game Module Dependency Injection Improvements

## Overview
This document outlines the necessary improvements to the dependency injection system in the GameModule to ensure proper functionality of all services and repositories.

## Current Issue
The `RewardsService` in the `GameModule` had a dependency resolution error because `RewardTransactionRepository` was not properly registered in the module context. This caused an issue where NestJS couldn't resolve dependencies for `RewardsService` at index [0].

## Completed Improvements
- Created a custom `RewardTransactionRepository` class
- Added `RewardTransaction` entity to the `TypeOrmModule.forFeature([...])` array
- Registered the `RewardTransactionRepository` in the providers array
- Modified `RewardsService` constructor to use the custom repository

## Future Tasks

### Short-term
- [ ] Review other services in the GameModule for similar dependency injection issues
- [ ] Add unit tests to verify proper dependency injection 
- [ ] Create integration tests for the `RewardsService` using the repository pattern

### Medium-term
- [ ] Refactor other repositories to follow the same pattern:
  - [ ] Convert direct repository injections to custom repository classes
  - [ ] Ensure all entities are properly registered in the module
  - [ ] Update services to use the custom repositories
- [ ] Add proper error handling to repository methods
- [ ] Implement transaction support for critical operations

### Long-term
- [ ] Consider implementing a domain-driven design approach
- [ ] Separate repositories into a dedicated data access layer
- [ ] Create abstractions (interfaces) for repositories to make testing easier
- [ ] Add comprehensive documentation for all repositories and their methods

## Best Practices
1. Always create custom repository classes for entities
2. Register both the entity and the repository in the module
3. Use proper dependency injection in service constructors
4. Follow NestJS patterns for repository implementation
5. Add proper error handling to all repository methods
6. Add query method documentation to make understanding the repository easier
