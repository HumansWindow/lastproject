# Admin Dashboard Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for the AliveHuman admin dashboard that will run on `admin.alivehuman.com`. The admin dashboard will provide monitoring and management capabilities for the AliveHuman platform.

## Technical Stack
- **Framework**: React Admin with Next.js
- **UI Library**: Material UI (comes with React Admin)
- **Data Provider**: Custom implementation using axios to connect to our backend API
- **Authentication**: JWT-based auth with role-based access control
- **Port**: 3002 (Frontend: 3000, Backend: 3001, Admin: 3002)

## Features Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Setup and System Monitoring
1. Setup Next.js project with React Admin
2. Configure domain and routing for admin.alivehuman.com
3. Implement authentication for admin users
4. Create dashboard homepage with key metrics
5. System health monitoring:
   - Server status (uptime, CPU, memory usage)
   - API response times
   - Backend service health checks

### Phase 2: Blockchain Monitoring
1. Node status dashboard
2. RPC provider health monitoring
3. WebSocket connection status
4. Transaction monitoring
5. Smart contract event monitoring
6. Hot wallet balance monitoring

### Phase 3: User Management
1. User listing with search and filter
2. User profile details view
3. User account management (suspend, delete, etc.)
4. User activity logs
5. Session monitoring

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
1. Database monitoring and management
2. Error logging and alerting system
3. Notification system for critical events
4. Automated reporting
5. Admin action audit trail
6. Performance analytics dashboards

## Implementation Steps

1. **Initial Setup**
   - Initialize Next.js app with TypeScript
   - Install React Admin and dependencies
   - Configure build and deployment

2. **Core Structure**
   - Create app layout
   - Setup routing
   - Implement authentication
   - Create dashboard components

3. **API Integration**
   - Create data provider service
   - Connect to backend monitoring endpoints
   - Implement real-time data updates with WebSockets

4. **UI Components**
   - Create monitoring widgets
   - Implement data tables
   - Build charts and visualizations
   - Design forms for management actions

5. **Testing & Deployment**
   - Write unit tests for components
   - Implement end-to-end testing
   - Setup CI/CD pipeline
   - Configure domain and SSL

## Monitoring Endpoints to Integrate

### System Health
- `/health` - Overall system health
- `/metrics/memory` - Memory usage metrics
- `/blockchain/status` - Blockchain node status

### User Monitoring
- `/users` - User management
- `/users/sessions` - User session monitoring

### Blockchain Monitoring
- `/blockchain/nodes` - Node status
- `/blockchain/transactions` - Transaction monitoring
- `/blockchain/wallets` - Hot wallet monitoring

## Next Steps
1. Initialize the Next.js project with React Admin
2. Create the basic folder structure
3. Implement the data provider to connect to our backend APIs
4. Build the dashboard home page with system monitoring
