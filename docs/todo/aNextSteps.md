# Next Steps for Profile System and Field Standardization

**Date**: April 26, 2025  
**Status**: Planning  
**Priority**: High

## Overview

This document outlines the next steps following the successful resolution of the `userId` vs `user_id` field naming inconsistency in the profile system. While the immediate issue has been fixed and the initial recommendations have been implemented, these additional tasks will ensure long-term stability and prevent similar issues across the entire codebase.

## Completed Items

The following recommendations have been successfully implemented:

1. ✅ **Standardize naming conventions**: Created comprehensive naming conventions document at `/docs/standards/naming-conventions.md`
2. ✅ **Database trigger auditing**: Implemented script at `/scripts/audit-database-triggers.sh` 
3. ✅ **Enhanced error handling**: Developed `ProfileErrorHandlerService` for better error messages
4. ✅ **Naming convention documentation**: Created detailed documentation on field naming standards
5. ✅ **Automated tests**: Added unit, integration, and E2E tests for the profile workflow

## Next Steps: Implementation Plan

### 1. CI/CD Integration (Priority: High)

**Objective**: Make naming convention and database schema validation part of the automated workflow.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Add database trigger audit script to GitHub Actions or Jenkins workflow
- [ ] Configure pre-commit hooks for naming convention validation
- [ ] Integrate automated testing for the profile completion flow
- [ ] Set up notifications for potential naming inconsistency issues

**Implementation Details**:
1. Create a new workflow file (e.g., `.github/workflows/db-schema-validation.yml`)
2. Add execution of `/scripts/audit-database-triggers.sh` to the workflow
3. Set up husky and lint-staged for pre-commit validation
4. Ensure E2E tests run as part of CI pipeline

**Estimated Completion**: May 10, 2025  
**Assigned To**: DevOps Team

### 2. Developer Training (Priority: Medium)

**Objective**: Ensure all team members understand the importance of consistent field naming.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Schedule knowledge sharing session on naming conventions
- [ ] Create a training module for onboarding new developers
- [ ] Review naming conventions documentation with the entire team
- [ ] Develop a quick reference guide for field naming patterns

**Implementation Details**:
1. Prepare presentation slides based on naming conventions document
2. Schedule team workshop for May 15, 2025
3. Record session for future reference and onboarding
4. Create an interactive quiz to validate understanding

**Estimated Completion**: May 20, 2025  
**Assigned To**: Engineering Leads

### 3. Regular Audits (Priority: Medium)

**Objective**: Establish an ongoing process to identify and fix inconsistencies.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Set up quarterly reviews of database schema consistency
- [ ] Implement monitoring for profile completion error rates
- [ ] Schedule periodic reviews of database trigger functions
- [ ] Create dashboard for tracking naming inconsistencies

**Implementation Details**:
1. Configure automated quarterly audit jobs
2. Set up error rate monitoring in existing monitoring system
3. Create calendar invites for Q3/Q4 2025 schema reviews
4. Develop a reporting template for consistency issues

**Estimated Completion**: June 5, 2025  
**Assigned To**: Database Administrator

### 4. Codebase Standardization (Priority: High)

**Objective**: Apply consistent naming patterns across all modules.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Extend naming convention standardization beyond the profile module
- [ ] Implement a code generator for entity-to-database mapping
- [ ] Refactor existing inconsistent code in other modules
- [ ] Run full database schema audit to identify other inconsistencies

**Implementation Details**:
1. Use the `id-standardization-plan.md` as a guide
2. Start with high-traffic modules (auth, wallet, sessions)
3. Create standardized TypeORM entity templates
4. Run the `fix-id-inconsistencies.js` script on other modules

**Estimated Completion**: July 15, 2025  
**Assigned To**: Backend Team

### 5. Project-Specific Tasks (Priority: Medium)

**Objective**: Address known project-specific configuration issues.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Standardize environment variable naming (e.g., `DB_PASSWORD` vs `DATABASE_PASSWORD`)
- [ ] Update all service configuration files with correct database credentials
- [ ] Implement configuration validation at startup
- [ ] Create documentation on service restart procedures

**Implementation Details**:
1. Audit all `.env` files and configuration templates
2. Use consistent casing for password (`aliveHumans@2024`)
3. Add a validation step in application bootstrap process
4. Update deployment documentation with explicit restart instructions

**Estimated Completion**: May 30, 2025  
**Assigned To**: Infrastructure Team

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Inconsistencies in other modules | High | Medium | Prioritize code reviews and automated testing |
| Resistance to naming conventions | Medium | Low | Training and clear documentation |
| CI/CD integration complexity | Medium | Medium | Start with simple validations and expand |
| Schedule conflicts for training | Low | High | Provide recorded sessions and self-paced materials |
| Performance impact of audits | Medium | Low | Run audits during off-hours and optimize scripts |

## Dependencies

- Access to CI/CD platform for workflow integration
- Developer availability for training sessions
- Database schema modification permissions
- Approval for routine maintenance windows

## Success Metrics

1. Zero naming inconsistency errors in production
2. 100% developer training completion
3. All new code following naming conventions
4. Automated CI checks passing on all PRs
5. Quarterly audit completion with no critical findings
