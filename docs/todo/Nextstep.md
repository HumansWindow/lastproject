## Technical Details

### Blockchain Constants Implementation

- Created a centralized constants file for network configuration
- Standardized on Polygon (chain ID: 0x89 / 137) as the default network
- Added network metadata for adding Polygon network to wallets
- Implemented helper functions:
  - `normalizeBlockchainType`: Normalizes network type strings to our enum
  - `switchToPolygonNetwork`: Switches wallet to Polygon network
  - `isPolygonNetwork`: Checks if current network is Polygon

### Trust Wallet Specific Implementation

- Trust Wallet has specific quirks where it may report Ethereum even on Polygon
- Updated the network detection logic to properly identify Polygon network
- Added automatic switching to Polygon network when Trust Wallet connects
- Improved error handling for network switching scenarios
- Enhanced signing methods with better logging and error handling

### Authentication Challenge Updates

- Updated the authentication challenge to include network information
- Added network information in the message that users sign
- Enriched wallet info with default network when network info is missing
- Improved logging for better debugging of network-related issues

### Trust Wallet Authentication Fix Details (May 13, 2025)

#### Network Type Detection and Enforcement
- Trust Wallet often reports itself as "ethereum" even when on Polygon network
- Implemented a specialized blockchain type detection for Trust Wallet that:
  - Checks the chainId to determine actual network regardless of reported type
  - Forces blockchain type to Polygon for consistency in authentication
  - Preserves the actual chainId for transaction purposes
  - Ensures all backend communication uses "polygon" as the blockchain type

#### Message Signing Enhancement
- Trust Wallet has unique signature format requirements
- Implemented three progressive signature approaches:
  1. Standard ethers.js signer for normal cases
  2. Raw provider personal_sign method as fallback
  3. eth_sign as last resort (with appropriate security warnings)
- Removed any formatting/modification of challenge message to ensure exact match

#### Authentication Debugging
- Enhanced the AuthDebugger with Trust Wallet specific diagnostics
- Added specialized troubleshooting steps for common Trust Wallet issues
- Created state reset functionality to recover from corrupted auth state
- Implemented detailed logging of each authentication step

### Authentication Flow Fix Details

- Challenge Request:
  - Ensured 'polygon' blockchain type is consistently sent with requests
  - Added request IDs for better tracking in logs
  - Enhanced error handling and diagnostics

- Challenge Signing:
  - Pass the exact challenge string without any formatting or modifications
  - Improved error logging with detailed context information
  - Added fallback signing mechanisms for Trust Wallet quirks

- Authentication:
  - Ensured consistent blockchain type in all authentication requests
  - Added detailed diagnostic information to error responses
  - Implemented proper error handling for all authentication scenarios

## Next Steps

1. **API Endpoint Configuration Fix** (Priority: Critical)
   - Fix the frontend API endpoint configuration to correctly point to the working backend URLs
   - Update environment variables to use correct HTTP (not HTTPS) endpoints for local development
   - Add proper fallback mechanisms when primary endpoints are unreachable
   - Create health check endpoint at `/auth/wallet/health` to match frontend expectations
   - Update API service to handle connection failures gracefully
   - **Implementation details**:
     - Frontend is trying to access `/auth/wallet/health` at port 3000 but it's returning 404
     - Backend tests confirm wallet authentication works correctly at port 3001
     - Need to synchronize the API URLs between frontend and backend

2. **Trust Wallet Authentication Monitoring** (Priority: High)
   - Monitor Trust Wallet authentication success rates
