# Wallet Authentication Implementation Checklist

## Immediate Fixes

### Frontend (Already Fixed)
- [x] Add debouncing to WalletConnectButton using useRef to track authentication attempts
- [x] Simplify useEffect dependency arrays in WalletConnectButton
- [x] Add cleanup functions to prevent memory leaks with authentication timeouts
- [x] Implement better error handling to recover from failed authentication attempts
- [x] Use useCallback for performAuthentication to prevent unnecessary re-renders

### Backend (Implemented)
- [x] Implement challenge cache in WalletAuthController to track issued challenges
- [x] Add request deduplication in WalletAuthController's connect method
- [x] Improve transaction handling in AuthService.walletLogin for atomic operations
- [x] Add wallet address normalization consistently across all methods
- [x] Update error handling to properly roll back partial user/wallet creation
- [x] Add request tracking IDs to correlate frontend/backend logs
- [x] Fix database issue with refresh_tokens table (missing created_at column)

### Testing
- [x] Test WalletConnectButton to ensure single connection request
- [x] Verify user creation works properly with the improved flow
- [x] Test error scenarios (invalid signature, timeout, etc.)
- [x] Monitor logs to ensure no duplicate connection requests

## How to Test

### Frontend Testing
1. Open browser dev tools and monitor network requests
2. Click on the WalletConnectButton
3. Verify only one request is sent to `/auth/wallet/connect`
4. Complete the wallet signature process
5. Verify only one request is sent to `/auth/wallet/authenticate`

### Backend Testing
1. Monitor backend logs during wallet connection attempts
2. Verify no duplicate "Wallet connection request received" messages for the same address
3. Check user creation in database to ensure no duplicate users/wallets
4. Test error recovery by simulating failures at different points in the flow

## Implementation Notes

### For Frontend
- The main issue was in the WalletConnectButton component's useEffect dependency array
- Adding proper state tracking with useRef prevents reconnection loops
- Using useCallback properly memoizes functions to prevent unnecessary effect triggers
- Adding timeout cleanup prevents stale authentication attempts

### For Backend
- ✅ Implemented challenge cache in WalletAuthController to prevent duplicate challenges
- ✅ Added wallet address normalization for consistent lookup and storage
- ✅ Added request tracking IDs for better debugging and log correlation
- ✅ Fixed database schema issue with missing created_at column in refresh_tokens table
- ✅ Improved error handling with clearer error messages and proper transaction rollback

## Additional Improvements

### Frontend Enhancement
- [ ] Add wallet connectivity status indicator
- [ ] Implement better error UX with friendly error messages
- [ ] Add connection timeout handling with automatic retry
- [ ] Add wallet network detection and switching
- [ ] Standardize API URL configuration to use port 3001 consistently
- [ ] Clear localStorage cached URLs to prevent connection issues

### Backend Enhancement
- [ ] Implement rate limiting for wallet connection requests
- [ ] Add enhanced security with device fingerprinting
- [ ] Implement multi-wallet support for single user accounts
- [ ] Add analytics for tracking authentication success rates
- [ ] Fix refresh_tokens table schema (rename expires_at to expiresAt or vice versa for consistency)
- [ ] Implement database transaction rollback on all authentication errors
- [ ] Add comprehensive error logging for wallet authentication failures
- [ ] Create automated health check for wallet authentication services

## API URL Refactoring Plan

### Issues Identified
- [x] Inconsistent API URL configuration (mixing port 3000 and 3001)
- [x] Cached localStorage URLs causing connection problems
- [x] Frontend attempting to connect to incorrect endpoints

### Refactoring Steps
- [x] Create `fix-api-url.sh` script to standardize API configuration
- [x] Set up `.env.local` with correct NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL value
- [x] Implement localStorage clearing on frontend startup
- [x] Create port checking script to ensure backend runs on correct port
- [ ] Consider consolidating API endpoints under consistent URL structure
- [ ] Implement API versioning for better backward compatibility
- [ ] Create API route documentation to ensure frontend uses correct endpoints
- [ ] Add connectivity testing on startup to detect API configuration issues

### How to Test API URL Fix
1. Run `./fix-api-url.sh` script to apply URL configuration fixes
2. Clear browser localStorage to remove any cached URLs
3. Ensure backend is running on port 3001 using `./check-backend-port.sh`
4. Restart frontend with `cd frontend && npm run dev`
5. Test wallet authentication to verify successful API connections
