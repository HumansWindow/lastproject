Prompt for Connecting SHAHI Coin to Hot Wallet and Backend
To integrate your SHAHI token contract with your hot wallet and backend for the minting system, I recommend creating a new prompt that specifies exactly what you need. Here's a suggested prompt and the files you should include:

Prompt to Use in New Session:

I need help integrating my SHAHI token contract with my existing hot wallet implementation and NestJS backend. I need to create:

1. A blockchain service in my NestJS app that connects to the SHAHICoin contract
2. A minting service that implements the signature verification flow
3. A controller with REST endpoints for first-time and annual minting
4. Integration with my device detection service for secure proof generation
5. A task scheduler for token expiration checking

My token has a unique minting system where users get 1 SHAHI per year (with a 1-year cooldown), split 50/50 between user wallet and admin wallet. User-earned tokens can only be spent in-app. The minting requires signature verification and checks to prevent fraud.

Please implement the necessary backend files for this integration, ensuring security, proper wallet connections, and efficient processing.
Files to Include:

/home/alivegod/Desktop/LastProject/backend/src/blockchain/contracts/SHAHICoin.sol
/home/alivegod/Desktop/LastProject/backend/src/blockchain/contracts/SHAHIStorage.sol
/home/alivegod/Desktop/LastProject/backend/src/blockchain/hotwallet/README.md
/home/alivegod/Desktop/LastProject/backend/src/blockchain/blockchain.module.ts
/home/alivegod/Desktop/LastProject/backend/src/auth/auth.module.ts
/home/alivegod/Desktop/LastProject/EXPLAIN.md
What You Should Expect:

The AI will create several new files that integrate your SHAHI token with your hot wallet and backend:

A shahi-token.service.ts to interact with the contract
A minting.service.ts for handling minting operations
A minting.controller.ts with REST API endpoints
Database entities to track minting records
Required DTOs and interfaces
A scheduled task for checking expired tokens
These files will handle signature generation, verification, secure minting, and enforce the 1-year cooldown period, all integrated with your existing authentication, device detection, and hot wallet systems.

By providing this context and files, the AI will have enough information to create appropriate integration code that matches your existing architecture and requirements. The solution should focus on secure implementation of the signature-based minting system with proper backend tracking of device IDs and visit history.
