# Wallet Authentication and Profile Update Summary

## Current Issues Identified (April 24, 2025)

### Authentication Flow
- Wallet connection and initial authentication is successful (tokens are generated)
- Backend logs show tokens are properly created and stored
- However, subsequent API requests fail with 401 Unauthorized errors

### Profile Endpoints
- GET requests to `/users/profile` return 401 Unauthorized despite successful wallet auth
- POST requests to `/users/profile/complete` return 404 Not Found (missing endpoint)
- Profile completion feature cannot work due to these issues

### Memory Concerns
- MemoryMonitorService showing consistent high memory usage warnings
- Regular warnings about "High memory usage detected, suggesting manual garbage collection"

### Token Handling
- Authentication tokens seem to be generated but not properly applied/accepted in API requests
- JWT validation might be failing for subsequent requests

## Root Causes

1. **Token Application Issue**: The authentication token is received by the frontend but may not be properly included in subsequent request headers
   
2. **Missing API Endpoint**: The `/users/profile/complete` endpoint is not implemented in the backend

3. **JWT Configuration**: Possible mismatch between token generation and validation settings

4. **Memory Management**: Backend service may need optimization for memory usage

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Authentication Token Usage**:
   - Ensure access token is properly stored after authentication
   - Verify token is included in the Authorization header for all protected API requests
   - Check token format (should be "Bearer [token]")
   - Verify that axios interceptors are correctly configured for all API clients

2. **Implement Profile Completion Endpoint**:
   - Create the missing `/users/profile/complete` endpoint in the profile controller
   - Implement the necessary DTO and service methods

3. **JWT Configuration Review**:
   - Review JWT strategy configuration in the backend
   - Ensure token verification is correctly configured

4. **Memory Optimization**:
   - Review background services like MintingService for memory leaks
   - Consider implementing garbage collection scheduling if needed

5. **Logging Improvement**:
   - Add more detailed logging around token validation failures
   - Implement request tracing to identify exact point of authentication failure
