# Wallet Authentication Debugging Guide

## Overview

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for debugging wallet authentication flows between the frontend and backend of the LastProject application. Use these tools and methods to track, log, and diagnose authentication issues.

## Quick Start

To capture backend logs and debug wallet authentication:

```bash
# From project root, run the logging script
./log-backend.sh

# In a separate terminal, start the frontend
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

This will start the backend with full logging to a timestamped file in the `logs` directory.

## Backend Logging Options

### Option 1: Using the provided script
```bash
./log-backend.sh
```

The script:
- Creates a logs directory if it doesn't exist
- Generates a log file with timestamp
- Sets increased memory limits for Node.js
- Redirects all output (including errors) to the log file

### Option 2: Manual redirection
```bash
cd backend
npm run start:dev > ../logs/backend-manual.log 2>&1
```

### Option 3: View and log simultaneously
```bash
cd backend
npm run start:dev | tee ../logs/backend-tee.log
```

## Analyzing Authentication Logs

### Wallet Authentication Flow

The typical wallet authentication flow includes:

1. **Challenge Request**:
   - Frontend requests a challenge from the backend
   - Backend generates a unique challenge string for the wallet address

2. **Wallet Signing**:
   - Frontend prompts user to sign the challenge with their wallet
   - Web3 provider (like MetaMask) handles the signing process

3. **Signature Verification**:
   - Frontend sends the signature to the backend
   - Backend verifies the signature matches the wallet address

4. **User Authentication**:
   - Backend creates or retrieves user account for the wallet
   - Backend generates authentication tokens
   - Frontend stores tokens for subsequent authenticated requests

### Log Analysis Commands

```bash
# Find all wallet-related authentication entries
grep -i "wallet\|auth\|sign\|challenge" logs/backend-logs-*.txt

# Look for errors
grep -E "ERROR|WARN|Exception|failed|denied" logs/backend-logs-*.txt

# Filter for a specific wallet address (replace with actual address)
grep -i "0x123...abc" logs/backend-logs-*.txt

# Check memory usage patterns
grep -i "memory" logs/backend-logs-*.txt
```

## Frontend Debugging

Enable the authentication debugger in the browser console:

```javascript
// Open your browser's developer console and run:
window.authDebugger.startMonitoring();

// Attempt wallet authentication and watch the logs

// When finished:
window.authDebugger.stopMonitoring();
```

## End-to-End Authentication Testing

1. **Start backend logging**
   ```bash
   ./log-backend.sh
   ```

2. **Start frontend**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Enable frontend debugging**
   - Open browser console
   - Run `window.authDebugger.startMonitoring()`

4. **Test authentication flow**
   - Connect wallet
   - Sign the challenge
   - Verify successful login

5. **Analyze logs**
   - Check frontend console for client-side events
   - Examine backend logs for server-side processing
   - Compare timestamps to track request-response flow

## Common Authentication Issues

### 1. Challenge Generation Failures
- **Symptoms**: No challenge is generated, or errors in the console
- **Check**: Backend logs for errors in the challenge generation endpoint
- **Solution**: Verify the wallet address format and backend connection

### 2. Signature Verification Failures
- **Symptoms**: "Invalid signature" errors
- **Check**: Compare the signed message with the original challenge
- **Solution**: Ensure the exact challenge string is being signed without modifications

### 3. User Account Issues
- **Symptoms**: Authentication succeeds but user has no permissions
- **Check**: Backend logs for user creation or retrieval process
- **Solution**: Verify user account exists and has proper roles/permissions

### 4. Token Generation Problems
- **Symptoms**: Authentication succeeds but subsequent requests fail
- **Check**: Backend logs for token generation and expiry settings
- **Solution**: Verify tokens are being properly stored and refreshed

### 5. Memory Issues
- **Symptoms**: Backend becomes unresponsive during authentication
- **Check**: Memory usage warnings in logs
- **Solution**: Restart backend with increased memory allocation or optimize code

## Database Verification

To verify wallet authentication entries in the database:

```bash
cd backend
# Run your database query tool (e.g., psql)
# Example query:
# SELECT * FROM users WHERE wallet_address = '0x...';
```

## Legacy vs. New Authentication

If you're transitioning between authentication systems, verify:

1. Which authentication system is being used
2. Whether wallet addresses are stored consistently
3. If tokens from both systems are recognized

Looking at the logs you shared, I can see the wallet authentication process is working in terms of receiving connection requests, but there appears to be a potential issue with user creation or authentication. Let me help you determine the next steps for improving the wallet authentication process.

First, let me check the wallet authentication implementation to better understand the current flow:Based on my analysis of your project's codebase, I can suggest the next steps for wallet authentication improvement. Let me outline what I found:

## Current Wallet Authentication Flow

Your wallet authentication is working at a basic level with a standard flow:
1. The frontend requests a challenge for a wallet address
2. The backend generates a challenge string
3. The user signs this challenge with their wallet
4. The signature is sent to the backend for verification
5. Upon verification, tokens are issued for authentication

## Next Steps for Wallet Authentication Enhancement

Here are the specific actions I recommend for improving your wallet authentication system:

### 1. Implement User Onboarding for New Wallet Connections

The logs showed wallet connections with no existing user. You should create a better onboarding flow:

```
- Create a profile collection screen after first successful wallet authentication
- Request optional email for notifications and recovery options
- Add username/profile setup step
```

### 2. Fix the Swagger Documentation Issue

I noticed an error in your logs: `[ERROR] [Swagger] Failed to create Swagger document: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'values')`. This is preventing your API documentation from generating correctly.

You should check your DTO classes and controllers for missing or incorrectly formatted Swagger decorators.

### 3. Enhance Security with Device Verification

The code already has device fingerprinting, but you should enhance it by:
- Adding a confirmation process for new devices
- Implementing device management in the user dashboard
- Adding notifications for new device logins

### 4. Improve Error Handling for Failed Wallet Authentication

The current error handling could be more user-friendly:
- Add specific error messages for different failure scenarios
- Implement better UI feedback during the authentication process
- Create recovery paths for failed authentications

### 5. Implement Multi-Wallet Support

Your code shows support for multiple blockchain networks, but you should ensure users can connect multiple wallets to one account:
- Add a wallet management section in the user profile
- Allow connecting additional wallets to an existing account
- Enable switching between connected wallets

### 6. Add Session Management

Improve session handling for wallet-authenticated users:
- Implement proper token refresh mechanisms
- Add the ability to view and manage active sessions
- Allow remote session termination

### 7. Update Frontend Components

Your frontend could use some improvements to better handle the authentication flow:
- Add loading states and better error messaging
- Create a cohesive UI component for wallet connection status
- Implement network status indicators

### 8. Fine-tune Debugging and Monitoring

Your debugging tools are already good, but could be enhanced:
- Set up structured logging for wallet authentication events
- Create dashboards for monitoring authentication success rates
- Implement analytics for tracking wallet types and user behaviors

### Next Immediate Action

I recommend starting with fixing the Swagger documentation issue since it's directly impacting your API documentation, then implementing the user onboarding flow for new wallet connections. This will give your users a better experience while also collecting important profile information.

Would you like me to help you implement any of these specific improvements first?
