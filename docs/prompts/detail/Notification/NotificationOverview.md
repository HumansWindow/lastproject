# Notification System Overview

The notification system provides real-time notifications to users across the platform. It allows for immediate delivery of important updates, alerts, and information to users while they interact with the application.

## Purpose

The notification system serves the following purposes:

1. **Real-time Updates**: Deliver instant information to users without requiring page refreshes
2. **User Engagement**: Keep users informed about relevant activities and events
3. **System Alerts**: Notify users about important system events or status changes
4. **Transaction Updates**: Inform users about blockchain transaction status changes
5. **Personalized Messages**: Send targeted notifications based on user preferences and activity

## Architecture Components

The notification system consists of several interconnected components:

### Backend Components

1. **Notification Service**: Core service for creating, managing, and delivering notifications
2. **WebSocket Gateway**: Handles real-time delivery of notifications to connected clients
3. **Notification Repository**: Stores notification data in the database
4. **Notification Controllers**: RESTful API endpoints for managing notifications

### Frontend Components

1. **WebSocket Connection Manager**: Manages WebSocket connections with the server
2. **Notification Service**: Handles notification logic on the client side
3. **Notification Storage**: Local storage for notifications when offline
4. **UI Components**: Notification bell, notification list, and individual notification items

## Data Flow

1. **Notification Creation**:
   - A system event occurs (e.g., blockchain transaction, user action)
   - The backend service creates a notification in the database
   - The notification is sent to users via WebSocket

2. **Notification Delivery**:
   - The WebSocket gateway sends the notification to all connected clients matching criteria
   - The frontend notification service receives the notification
   - The UI is updated to show the new notification

3. **Notification Interaction**:
   - User views notifications
   - User marks notifications as read
   - Read status is synced to the server

## Notification Categories

The system supports different notification categories:

1. **Info**: General information notifications
2. **Success**: Successful operation notifications
3. **Warning**: Caution or warning notifications
4. **Error**: Error or failure notifications

## Persistence

Notifications are persisted in multiple locations:

1. **Server Database**: Long-term storage of all notifications
2. **Client Local Storage**: Temporary cache of recent notifications
3. **In-Memory Store**: Current session notifications

## Implementation Considerations

### Performance

- WebSocket connections should be efficiently managed
- Notification delivery should be optimized for high volume
- Database queries should be indexed properly

### Security

- Authentication for WebSocket connections
- Authorization for notification access
- Sanitization of notification content

### Offline Support

- Local storage for notifications when offline
- Synchronization when connection is restored

### User Experience

- Non-intrusive notification display
- Ability to mark as read/unread
- Filtering and sorting options
- Accessibility considerations
