# Diary System Implementation Guide

This document provides a step-by-step guide to implementing a comprehensive diary system with both backend and frontend components.

## System Overview

The diary system allows users to:
- Create personal diary entries with rich text, images, and tags
- View, edit, and delete their entries
- Filter and search through past entries
- Set privacy levels for entries
- Receive reminders to create entries
- View analytics on their journaling habits

## Implementation Order

Follow this recommended order to efficiently implement the diary system:

1. **Backend Development** - [1-DiaryBackendSetup.md](./1-DiaryBackendSetup.md)
   - Set up database models and relationships
   - Implement CRUD operations for diary entries
   - Create endpoints for diary management
   - Add privacy controls and user-specific features
   - Implement search and filtering capabilities
   - Set up notifications and reminders system

2. **Frontend Development** - [2-DiaryFrontendSetup.md](./2-DiaryFrontendSetup.md)
   - Create diary entry components
   - Implement rich text editor integration
   - Build diary listing and detail views
   - Add filtering and search functionality
   - Create analytics and insights dashboard
   - Implement responsive design for mobile access

3. **Integration & Testing** - [3-DiaryIntegrationTesting.md](./3-DiaryIntegrationTesting.md)
   - Integrate backend and frontend components
   - Implement end-to-end tests for diary features
   - Performance testing for large diary collections
   - User acceptance testing scenarios
   - Security testing for privacy controls

## AI-Assisted Implementation

When using AI to help implement the diary system:

1. Start with database schema design and API endpoint planning
2. Break down the UI into component hierarchy
3. For each feature:
   - Begin with data models and interfaces
   - Implement backend API endpoints
   - Create frontend components
   - Test the integration

4. Ensure privacy and data security at each step
5. Follow established project patterns for consistency

## Quality Assurance

Throughout implementation, ensure:

1. All diary entries are properly associated with users
2. Privacy controls are strictly enforced
3. Image uploads are properly handled and validated
4. Rich text content is properly sanitized
5. Search functionality is optimized for performance
6. Mobile responsiveness is maintained throughout

## Implementation Timeline

Suggested timeline for implementation:

1. **Week 1**: Database models and basic CRUD operations
2. **Week 2**: API endpoints and service layer
3. **Week 3**: Frontend diary creation and listing components
4. **Week 4**: Search, filtering, and analytics features
5. **Week 5**: Testing, optimization, and final integration

By following this guide and using the provided prompts, you'll be able to efficiently implement a robust diary system that integrates seamlessly with the rest of the application.
