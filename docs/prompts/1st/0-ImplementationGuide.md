# Project Implementation Guide

This document provides a step-by-step guide to implementing the standardized project architecture using the prompt files created for each component.

## Project Overview

The project is structured as a monorepo using Yarn Workspaces with the following main packages:

- **backend**: NestJS application with modular architecture
- **frontend**: Next.js application with modern structure
- **admin**: Next.js admin dashboard
- **mobile**: React Native mobile application
- **shared**: Common code and utilities

## Implementation Order

Follow this recommended order to efficiently implement the project:

1. **Monorepo Setup** - [1-MonorepoSetup.md](./1-MonorepoSetup.md)
   - Initialize the monorepo structure
   - Configure workspaces and base configurations
   - Set up shared dependencies
   - Create development environment with Docker

2. **Shared Package** - [1-MonorepoSetup.md#shared-package-setup](./1-MonorepoSetup.md#shared-package-setup)
   - Create common types, interfaces and utilities
   - Set up cross-platform compatibility

3. **Backend Development** - [2-BackendSetup.md](./2-BackendSetup.md)
   - Set up NestJS application structure
   - Implement database configuration
   - Create core authentication module
   - Implement user management
   - Set up blockchain integration
   - Develop game module
   - Configure WebSocket functionality

4. **Frontend Development** - [3-FrontendSetup.md](./3-FrontendSetup.md)
   - Configure Next.js application
   - Implement API client layer
   - Create authentication context and hooks
   - Build wallet integration components
   - Set up real-time communication
   - Develop game UI components
   - Create diary system components

5. **Admin Dashboard** - [4-AdminDashboard.md](./4-AdminDashboard.md)
   - Set up admin application
   - Create admin authentication
   - Implement user management interface
   - Build content management system
   - Develop analytics dashboard
   - Create system monitoring interface

6. **Mobile Application** - [5-MobileApplication.md](./5-MobileApplication.md)
   - Configure React Native setup
   - Implement mobile authentication
   - Create mobile wallet integration
   - Build mobile game interface
   - Set up notifications system
   - Implement offline-first data strategy

7. **Testing & Deployment** - [6-TestingAndDeployment.md](./6-TestingAndDeployment.md)
   - Create testing strategy
   - Configure CI/CD pipeline
   - Set up deployment workflows
   - Implement database migration strategy
   - Add security measures
   - Apply performance optimizations

## AI-Assisted Implementation

When using AI to help implement these components:

1. Start with high-level architecture prompts from each component file
2. Break down complex modules into smaller, focused implementation tasks
3. For each feature:
   - Begin with interfaces and types
   - Implement core functionality
   - Add UI components
   - Test the implementation

4. When encountering issues:
   - Create focused prompts with specific error messages or challenges
   - Provide context about the specific architecture and patterns
   - Use the relevant prompt file as a reference

## Quality Assurance

Throughout implementation, ensure:

1. Consistent code style across all packages
2. Comprehensive test coverage
3. Documentation for major components
4. Type safety throughout the application
5. Security best practices
6. Performance optimization

## Architecture Resources

Reference the overall architecture documents:
- [ProjectSetup.md](./ProjectSetup.md): Overall project architecture
- [BackendFiles.Md](./BackendFiles.Md): Backend file structure reference
- [FrontendFiles.md](./FrontendFiles.md): Frontend file structure reference
- [ProjectOverview.md](./ProjectOverview.md): High-level project overview

## Implementation Timeline

Suggested timeline for implementation:

1. **Week 1**: Monorepo setup and shared package implementation
2. **Weeks 2-4**: Backend core functionality
3. **Weeks 5-7**: Frontend development
4. **Weeks 8-9**: Admin dashboard
5. **Weeks 10-12**: Mobile application
6. **Weeks 13-14**: Testing, security, and performance optimization
7. **Week 15**: Deployment pipeline and documentation

By following this guide and using the provided prompts, you'll be able to efficiently implement a standardized, clean architecture for the entire project.
