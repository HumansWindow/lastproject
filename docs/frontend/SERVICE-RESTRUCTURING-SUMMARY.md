# Frontend Services Restructuring Summary

## What We Accomplished

1. **Created a New Service Directory Structure:**
   - Organized services into logical categories
   - Separated API modules, realtime functionality, security, and storage concerns
   - Established a clean, maintainable architecture

2. **Set Up Core Service Files:**
   - Created a central api-client with proper token handling
   - Implemented a unified WebSocket manager
   - Enhanced type safety with proper interfaces
   - Created consistent interfaces for realtime services

3. **Fixed Critical Dependency Issues:**
   - Resolved circular dependencies by restructuring imports
   - Created barrel files for each module to simplify imports
   - Established a clearer dependency structure

4. **Added Missing Type Definitions:**
   - Created API types for common entities
   - Added extended diary types to support frontend features
   - Added WebSocket event type definitions
   - Improved TypeScript coverage with proper interfaces

## Current Status

The service folder restructuring is complete, but there are still TypeScript errors that need to be fixed in a follow-up session. Most of these are related to:

1. **Method Name Inconsistencies:**
   - `subscribeToBalanceChanges` vs `subscribeToBalanceUpdates`
   - Component usages need to be aligned with the new interface

2. **Type Mismatch Issues:**
   - `WebSocketError` missing `message` property
   - Diary component type issues (mixing `DiaryLocation` enum with string values)
   - Auth context issues with response handling

3. **Import Path Issues:**
   - Some modules are still referencing incorrect paths
   - Need to update paths to use the new structure

4. **Missing API Type Definitions:**
   - Several API types missing from api-types.ts

## Next Steps

In the next session, we should focus on:

1. **Fix Component-Level Issues:**
   - Update WalletBalanceMonitor and RealTimeBalance to use the correct methods
   - Fix WebSocketStatus to handle errors correctly
   - Update diary components to use the new ExtendedDiary interface consistently

2. **Complete API Types:**
   - Add missing API types (LoginResponse, RegisterResponse, etc.)
   - Create a more comprehensive API type file with all needed interfaces

3. **Fix Auth Context and Response Handling:**
   - Standardize how API responses are handled
   - Update the auth context to use the proper types and property names

4. **Address Import Path Issues:**
   - Fix remaining import paths to use the new structure
   - Make sure all services are importing from the correct barrel files

5. **Clean Up Unused Code:**
   - Remove any unused service files
   - Clean up debugging code from the restructuring process

6. **Setup Integration Tests:**
   - Create tests to verify the services work with the new structure
   - Validate that all critical paths are working

## Lessons Learned

1. The frontend service layer had grown organically without a clear architecture
2. Many files had mixed responsibilities, making maintenance difficult
3. Circular dependencies were causing TypeScript issues
4. Type definitions weren't standardized across the codebase
5. API naming wasn't consistent (e.g., getProfile vs getUserProfile)

By addressing these issues, the codebase will be more maintainable and easier to extend with new features.
