# Wallet Selector Update

**Date: April 24, 2025** (Updated)

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of our new wallet selector system, which provides a unified interface for connecting to multiple blockchain wallets across different networks (Ethereum, Binance Chain, Solana, and TON). The system includes a UI component that displays available wallets as cards with logos and names, allowing users to choose their preferred wallet.

## Features

- **Multi-blockchain support**: Ethereum, Binance Chain, Solana, and TON networks
- **Multiple wallet providers**:
  - Ethereum: MetaMask, WalletConnect, Binance Wallet, Trust Wallet
  - Solana: Phantom, Solflare
  - TON: TONKeeper
- **Automatic wallet detection**: Detects which wallets are installed in the user's browser
- **Cross-browser compatibility**: Works in Chrome, Brave, Firefox, and other modern browsers
- **Clean UI**: White background with wallet cards showing logos and names
- **Persistent connection**: Remembers the last connected wallet for better UX
- **Responsive design**: Works well on both desktop and mobile devices
- **Error handling**: Gracefully handles connection errors and signature issues
- **Browser extension safety**: Prevents common wallet extension errors before they occur

## Implementation Details

### Architecture

The wallet selector system consists of:

1. **Provider implementations**: Individual classes for each supported wallet
2. **Wallet Selector service**: Core service that manages wallet detection and selection
3. **UI Components**: React components for displaying and interacting with available wallets

### How It Works

1. **Detection**: When initialized, the wallet selector detects which wallets are available in the user's browser
2. **Selection**: The UI displays available wallets as cards with logos and names
3. **Connection**: When a user clicks on a wallet card, the system attempts to connect to that wallet
4. **Authentication**: After successful connection, the wallet information can be used for authentication
5. **Persistence**: The system remembers the last used wallet for a seamless experience on return visits

### Backend Authentication Flow

Based on our implementation, the wallet authentication process follows these steps:

1. **Connection Request**: The frontend sends a connection request to the `/auth/wallet/connect` endpoint
2. **Nonce Generation**: The backend generates a challenge nonce for the wallet to sign
3. **Wallet Signing**: The frontend requests the user to sign the challenge using their wallet
4. **Authentication**: The signed challenge is sent to the `/auth/wallet/authenticate` endpoint
5. **User Creation/Retrieval**: The backend either retrieves the existing user or creates a new user account if this is the first time connecting with this wallet address
6. **Device Tracking**: The system records the device information for security monitoring
7. **Token Generation**: The backend generates access and refresh tokens for the authenticated session
8. **Session Management**: A user session is created and tracked in the database

This flow ensures secure authentication while providing a seamless user experience across sessions.

### Code Example

```tsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import { Button } from 'react-bootstrap';
import { WalletSelectorModal } from '@/components/wallet-selector';
import { walletSelector } from '@/services/wallet';

const YourComponent = () => {
  const [showWalletModal, setShowWalletModal] = useState(false);

  const handleWalletConnect = (result) => {
    if (result.success) {
      console.log('Wallet connected:', result.walletInfo);
      // Continue with your authentication flow
    }
  };

  return (
    <>
      <Button onClick={() => setShowWalletModal(true)}>
        Connect Wallet
      </Button>

      <WalletSelectorModal
        show={showWalletModal}
        onHide={() => setShowWalletModal(false)}
        onConnect={handleWalletConnect}
      />
    </>
  );
};
```

## UI Component Documentation

### WalletSelector Component

The `WalletSelector` component displays available wallets as cards with logos and names.

**Props**:
- `onConnect`: Callback function called when a wallet is successfully connected
- `onCancel`: Callback function called when the user cancels the connection process

### WalletSelectorModal Component

The `WalletSelectorModal` component wraps the `WalletSelector` component in a modal dialog.

**Props**:
- `show`: Boolean indicating whether the modal should be visible
- `onHide`: Callback function called when the modal is closed
- `onConnect`: Callback function called when a wallet is successfully connected

## Next Steps

To fully integrate the wallet selector into our application, we need to:

1. **Add to Navbar**: Integrate the wallet connection button into the main navigation bar
2. **Account Display**: Show connected wallet information in the navbar
3. **Implement Authentication Flow**: Update our backend authentication to work with the new wallet selector
4. **Asset Management**: Add wallet-specific asset display based on the connected wallet type
5. **Create Wallet Icons**: Design or source appropriate icons for all supported wallets

### Navbar Integration Plan

To add the wallet selector to the navbar:

1. Update the Navbar component to include a wallet connection button
2. Display wallet status (connected/disconnected) in the navbar
3. Show abbreviated wallet address when connected
4. Implement a dropdown menu for wallet actions (disconnect, switch wallet, etc.)

**Implementation Example**:

```tsx
// In your Navbar component
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { Button, Dropdown } from 'react-bootstrap';
import { WalletSelectorModal } from '@/components/wallet-selector';
import { walletSelector, WalletInfo } from '@/services/wallet';

const Navbar = () => {
  const [showWalletModal, setShowWalletModal] = useState(false);
  const [walletInfo, setWalletInfo] = useState<WalletInfo | null>(null);
  
  // Try to connect to the last used wallet on page load
  useEffect(() => {
    const connectToLastWallet = async () => {
      const result = await walletSelector.connectToLastWallet();
      if (result?.success && result.walletInfo) {
        setWalletInfo(result.walletInfo);
      }
    };
    connectToLastWallet();
  }, []);

  const handleWalletConnect = (result: any) => {
    if (result.success && result.walletInfo) {
      setWalletInfo(result.walletInfo);
    }
  };

  const handleDisconnect = async () => {
    await walletSelector.disconnectWallet();
    setWalletInfo(null);
  };

  // Abbreviate wallet address for display
  const abbreviateAddress = (address: string) => {
    return `${address.substring(0, 6)}...${address.substring(address.length - 4)}`;
  };

  return (
    <nav className="navbar navbar-expand-lg navbar-light bg-light">
      {/* Other navbar items */}
      
      <div className="ms-auto">
        {!walletInfo ? (
          <Button 
            variant="outline-primary"
            onClick={() => setShowWalletModal(true)}
          >
            Connect Wallet
          </Button>
        ) : (
          <Dropdown>
            <Dropdown.Toggle variant="success" id="wallet-dropdown">
              {abbreviateAddress(walletInfo.address)}
            </Dropdown.Toggle>

            <Dropdown.Menu>
              <Dropdown.Item disabled>
                {walletInfo.blockchain} via {walletInfo.providerType}
              </Dropdown.Item>
              <Dropdown.Divider />
              <Dropdown.Item onClick={() => setShowWalletModal(true)}>
                Switch Wallet
              </Dropdown.Item>
              <Dropdown.Item onClick={handleDisconnect}>
                Disconnect
              </Dropdown.Item>
            </Dropdown.Menu>
          </Dropdown>
        )}
      </div>

      <WalletSelectorModal
        show={showWalletModal}
        onHide={() => setShowWalletModal(false)}
        onConnect={handleWalletConnect}
      />
    </nav>
  );
};
```

### Asset Management Next Steps

1. Implement blockchain-specific asset display components
2. Create wallet balance fetching services for each blockchain
3. Develop transaction history components specific to each blockchain
4. Implement asset transfer functionality based on the connected wallet type
