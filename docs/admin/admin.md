# Admin Dashboard Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for the AliveHuman admin dashboard that will run on `admin.alivehuman.com`. The admin dashboard provides monitoring and management capabilities for the AliveHuman platform.

## Technical Stack
- **Framework**: React Admin with Next.js
- **UI Library**: Material UI (comes with React Admin)
- **Data Provider**: Custom implementation using axios to connect to our backend API
- **Authentication**: JWT-based auth with role-based access control
- **Port**: 3003 (Frontend: 3000, Backend: 3001, Admin: 3003)

## Features Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Setup and System Monitoring ✅
1. ✅ Setup Next.js project with React Admin
2. ✅ Configure port (3003) for admin dashboard
3. ⏳ Configure domain routing for admin.alivehuman.com
4. ✅ Create dashboard homepage with key metrics
5. ✅ System health monitoring:
   - ✅ Server status (uptime, CPU, memory usage)
   - ✅ API response times
   - ✅ Backend service health checks

### Phase 2: Blockchain Monitoring ✅
1. ✅ Node status dashboard
2. ✅ RPC provider health monitoring
3. ✅ WebSocket connection status
4. ✅ Transaction monitoring
5. ✅ Hot wallet balance monitoring

### Phase 3: User Management ✅
1. ✅ User listing with search and filter
2. ✅ User status overview
3. ✅ User account management (suspend actions)
4. ✅ Session monitoring

### Phase 4: Advanced Features ⏳
1. ⏳ Database monitoring and management
2. ⏳ Error logging and alerting system
3. ⏳ Notification system for critical events
4. ⏳ Automated reporting
5. ⏳ Admin action audit trail
6. ⏳ Performance analytics dashboards

## Implementation Progress

### Completed:
1. ✅ Initialized Next.js project with React Admin and Material UI
2. ✅ Configured port 3003 for admin dashboard
3. ✅ Set up data provider to connect to backend API
4. ✅ Created core admin layout with resource structure
5. ✅ Created dashboard homepage with key metrics
6. ✅ Created system monitoring module with charts and metrics
7. ✅ Built blockchain monitoring module with node status and transactions
8. ✅ Implemented user management interface with search and filtering
9. ✅ Implemented admin authentication with JWT
10. ✅ Created backend AdminModule with necessary controllers
11. ✅ Set up CORS configuration to allow admin dashboard connections
12. ✅ Connected BlockchainMonitoring component to real backend data
13. ✅ Implemented custom login page with error handling
14. ✅ Added role-based access control for admin endpoints

### In Progress:
1. ⏳ Domain configuration for admin.alivehuman.com
2. ⏳ Error alerting and notification system
3. ⏳ Performance optimizations for large datasets

## Next Steps
1. Configure domain routing for admin.alivehuman.com
2. Implement real-time data updates using WebSockets
3. Create comprehensive error handling and alerting system
4. Implement admin action audit logging
5. Add database monitoring capabilities
6. Develop automated reporting functionality
7. Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment

## Backend Integration

The admin dashboard now connects to the backend through the following endpoints:

### System Health
- `/admin/system/health` - Overall system health metrics
- `/admin/system/metrics` - Detailed performance metrics
- `/admin/system/logs` - System logs access

### User Monitoring
- `/admin/users` - User management with pagination, sorting and filtering
- `/admin/users/:id` - Individual user details and actions

### Blockchain Monitoring
- `/admin/blockchain/status` - RPC endpoint status
- `/admin/blockchain/network-overview` - Network status overview
- `/admin/blockchain/transactions` - Transaction monitoring
- `/admin/blockchain/wallets` - Hot wallet monitoring

## Security Implementation

The admin dashboard implements the following security measures:

1. **JWT Authentication**: All API requests require a valid JWT token
2. **Role-Based Access Control**: Only users with the 'admin' role can access admin features
3. **Protected Routes**: All admin routes are protected and require authentication
4. **Token Expiration**: Admin tokens expire after 8 hours for improved security
5. **CORS Protection**: CORS is configured to only allow connections from authorized domains

## Usage Instructions

To run the admin dashboard locally:

```bash
# Navigate to the admin directory
cd admin

# Install dependencies (if not already done)
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

Access the dashboard at http://localhost:3003

For the dashboard to work properly, you'll need to:
1. Have the backend running on port 3001
2. Have an admin user created in the database
3. Login with valid admin credentials
