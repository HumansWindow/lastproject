Do you want to save this as the admin wallet in your .env file? (y/n): y
‚ùå Error: path.resolve is not a function . in env file and any where else , and can we make sure this 12 worlds and that we use in #file:cli-tools.mjs , is same , ? and this is the correct hot wallet ? 
## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Integration with Main Application Authentication
1. Create JWT validation middleware for the hot wallet system
2. Connect to the existing auth service in the main application
3. Implement role-based access control for different wallet operations
4. Add proper logging of authorization attempts

### 2. Security Monitoring & Alerting System
1. Create a dedicated alert service that extends the existing TransactionMonitor
2. Add webhook notification support for critical security events
3. Implement email notifications using the main application's mail service
4. Build a simple dashboard component for the admin panel to visualize alerts
5. Configure severity levels and response protocols for different alert types

### 3. Security Audit Preparation
1. Document all cryptographic implementations used in the system
2. Create a threat model document outlining potential attack vectors
3. Review and document security assumptions in the codebase
4. Prepare a comprehensive test suite focusing on security aspects
5. Collect dependency information and conduct an initial vulnerability scan

### 4. Cold Wallet Integration
1. Design a multi-signature wallet implementation for high-value storage
2. Create a secure protocol for moving funds between hot and cold wallets
3. Implement approval workflows requiring multiple signatures for large transactions
4. Add balance thresholds that automatically trigger cold wallet transfers
5. Design a secure key recovery mechanism for the cold wallet system

## Medium-Term Implementation

### 5. System Deployment Security
1. Create Docker containers with minimal permissions for wallet services
2. Configure network policies to isolate wallet components
3. Implement Kubernetes secrets for sensitive configuration
4. Set up monitoring and alerts for container security
5. Create secure backup procedures for wallet data

### 6. CI/CD Pipeline Security
1. Add automated security scanning to the build pipeline
2. Implement dependency vulnerability checking
3. Set up signing and verification of deployment artifacts
4. Create secure deployment strategies with proper rollback capabilities
5. Configure environment-specific security settings

### 7. User Interface Security
1. Implement transaction signing interface with clear security information
2. Create a secure PIN/password entry system for confirming sensitive operations
3. Add visible security indicators for transaction status and warnings
4. Implement session timeouts and automatic locking features
5. Add transaction confirmation screens with detailed security information

### 8. Comprehensive Testing
1. Create automated security tests for the entire wallet system
2. Perform penetration testing against the authentication system
3. Test error cases and exception handling thoroughly
4. Verify proper key management throughout the application lifecycle
5. Document and resolve all identified security issues

By following this plan, you'll create a significantly more secure hot wallet system integrated with your main application's security model.
