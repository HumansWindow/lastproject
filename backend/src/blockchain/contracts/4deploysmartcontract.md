# Multi-Chain Deployment Guide for SHAHI Coin

I need a comprehensive guide for deploying my SHAHI Coin smart contract to multiple blockchain networks. The contract is an upgradeable ERC20 token using OpenZeppelin's UUPS proxy pattern and includes advanced features like website-based minting, staking, and token restrictions.

## Requirements

Please provide a detailed step-by-step deployment guide that covers:

### Development Environment Setup
- Setting up a Hardhat project for multi-chain deployment
- Required dependencies and configurations
- Environment variables and security best practices

### Contract Preparation
- How to properly structure SHAHIStorage.sol for upgradeable patterns
- Testing strategies before deployment
- Gas optimization recommendations for high-cost functions

### Deployment Process
- Step-by-step deployment scripts for both implementation and proxy contracts
- Initializing the contract with proper parameters
- Contract verification on block explorers

### Multi-Chain Strategy
- Detailed process for deploying to Ethereum, Polygon, and BNB Chain (Phase 1)
- Bridge setup between chains for token interoperability
- Framework for future deployment to Solana and TON (Phase 2)

### Post-Deployment
- ABI extraction for frontend/backend integration
- How to perform and verify contract upgrades
- Managing admin functions securely across multiple chains

### Security Considerations
- Best practices for handling private keys during deployment
- Setting up multi-signature wallets for admin functions
- Monitoring and maintenance procedures

I want to ensure our deployment is secure, gas-efficient, and properly set up for all intended chains while maintaining the unique features of our token ecosystem.
