# SHAHI Coin Multi-Chain Deployment Commands

## DEPLOYMENT READY CHAINS
The following chains can be deployed immediately using the existing SHAHICoin.sol contract:

# Testnet deployments (start here for testing)
npm run deploy:polygon:testnet    # Deploy to Polygon Mumbai
npm run deploy:ethereum:testnet   # Deploy to Ethereum Goerli
npm run deploy:bsc:testnet        # Deploy to BNB Chain Testnet

# Mainnet deployments (when ready for production)
npm run deploy:polygon:mainnet    # Deploy to Polygon Mainnet
npm run deploy:ethereum:mainnet   # Deploy to Ethereum Mainnet
npm run deploy:bsc:mainnet        # Deploy to BNB Chain Mainnet

## BATCH DEPLOYMENT
You can deploy to all networks at once:

# Deploy to all testnets
npm run deploy:all:testnet

# Deploy to all mainnets (CAUTION: Only when fully tested)
npm run deploy:all:mainnet

## CONTRACT VERIFICATION
After deployment, verify your contracts on block explorers:

# Verify all contracts across networks
npm run verify:contracts:all

# Or verify on specific networks
npm run verify:contracts:ethereum
npm run verify:contracts:polygon
npm run verify:contracts:bsc

## FUTURE CHAIN INTEGRATION (Requires additional implementation)
The following chains require additional implementation steps:

# Bitcoin (via RSK) - Follow instructions in bitcoin-integration.md first
npm run deploy:bitcoin:testnet    # Deploy to RSK Testnet (Bitcoin)
npm run deploy:bitcoin:mainnet    # Deploy to RSK Mainnet (Bitcoin)

# Solana & TON - Follow instructions in phase2-networks.md first
# These implementations will be available in Phase 2

## MONITORING DEPLOYMENT
To monitor your deployment process and check logs:
tail -f deployment-logs.log       # View deployment logs in real-time
