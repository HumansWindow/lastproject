# Phase 2 Network Expansion: Solana & TON Integration

This document outlines the implementation strategy for extending SHAHI Coin to non-EVM blockchains in Phase 2 of our multi-chain deployment plan.

## Implementation Approach

Unlike Ethereum, Polygon, and BNB Chain which all use the EVM, both Solana and TON have completely different programming models that require custom implementations of the SHAHI token:

1. **Wrapped Token Approach**: Create wrapped versions of SHAHI on these networks
2. **Cross-Chain Bridges**: Establish secure bridging mechanisms between EVM chains and non-EVM chains
3. **Feature Parity**: Ensure key functionalities are maintained across all chains

## Solana Implementation

### Technical Architecture

1. **Token Standard**: SPL Token (Solana Program Library)
2. **Contract Language**: Rust with Anchor framework
3. **Token Features**:
   - Minting authority (restricted to bridge contracts)
   - Metadata program integration for token information
   - Optional: Program-derived accounts (PDAs) for staking functionality

### Implementation Steps

1. **Development Environment Setup**:
   ```bash
   # Install Solana CLI tools
   sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.solana.com/v1.14.10/install)"
   
   # Install Anchor framework
   npm install -g @project-serum/anchor-cli
   ```

2. **Token Creation**:
   ```bash
   # Create new project
   anchor init shahi-solana
   
   # Navigate to project directory
   cd shahi-solana
   
   # Build the project
   anchor build
   ```

3. **Token Program**:
   - Implement minting/burning capabilities controlled by bridge authority
   - Create metadata program integration for token symbol, name, etc.
   - Implement freezing/thawing authority for security measures

4. **Bridge Integration**:
   - Wormhole or Portal bridge for Solana-Ethereum bridging
   - Custom bridge implementation for direct Polygon-Solana transfers

### Deployment Process

1. Deploy to Solana Devnet for testing
2. Verify functionality with bridge contracts on testnet
3. Deploy to Solana Mainnet
4. Register token with major Solana wallets (Phantom, Solflare)

## TON Implementation

### Technical Architecture

1. **Token Standard**: Jetton standard on TON
2. **Contract Language**: FunC (TON's smart contract language)
3. **Token Features**:
   - Jetton wallet and Jetton minter contracts
   - Metadata storage on TON
   - Optional: Custom minter with role-based permissions

### Implementation Steps

1. **Development Environment Setup**:
   ```bash
   # Install TON development tools
   npm install -g ton-compiler ton-cli
   
   # Install Blueprint scaffold
   npm install -g @ton-community/blueprint
   ```

2. **Jetton Implementation**:
   ```bash
   # Create new TON project
   blueprint create shahi-ton
   
   # Navigate to project directory
   cd shahi-ton
   
   # Initialize Jetton template
   blueprint add jetton
   ```

3. **Token Program**:
   - Implement standard Jetton interfaces
   - Add custom logic for minting and burning
   - Implement custom admin controls similar to EVM token

4. **Bridge Integration**:
   - TON Bridge for TON-EVM connectivity
   - Orbs TON Access for easier integration with EVM chains

### Deployment Process

1. Deploy to TON Testnet
2. Test bridge functionality between TON and EVM chains
3. Deploy to TON Mainnet
4. Register with TON wallets (Tonkeeper, TonHub)

## Shared Bridge Infrastructure

### Cross-Chain Communication

For both Solana and TON, we'll need two components:
1. **Bridge Contracts**: On each chain to lock/unlock tokens
2. **Relayers**: Off-chain services to monitor events and trigger cross-chain transactions

### Security Considerations

1. **Multi-Signature Control**: Bridge contracts should use multi-sig governance
2. **Threshold Signatures**: Distributed signing for bridge authorities
3. **Rate Limiting**: Maximum volume restrictions per time period
4. **Freezable Bridges**: Emergency pause functionality

## Maintainability Plan

1. **Version Control**:
   - Separate repositories for each chain implementation
   - Shared library of common business logic patterns

2. **Operational Tools**:
   - Chain-specific monitoring tools
   - Cross-chain balance reconciliation checks
   - Bridge health monitoring dashboard

## Timeline and Resources

### Phase 2.1: Solana Integration
- Timeline: 6-8 weeks
- Resources:
  - 1-2 Rust/Anchor developers
  - 1 Bridge specialist
  - 1 Testing engineer

### Phase 2.2: TON Integration
- Timeline: 6-8 weeks
- Resources:
  - 1-2 FunC/TON developers
  - 1 Bridge specialist
  - 1 Testing engineer

## Budget Considerations

1. **Development Costs**:
   - Solana development: ~$30,000-50,000
   - TON development: ~$25,000-40,000
   - Bridge implementation: ~$40,000-60,000

2. **Operational Costs**:
   - Bridge relayer infrastructure: ~$1,000-2,000/month
   - Monitoring systems: ~$500-1,000/month
   - Security audits: ~$30,000-60,000

## Future Expansion Potential

After successful implementation on Solana and TON, the architecture can be further extended to:
1. **Algorand**: Using ASA (Algorand Standard Asset)
2. **Cosmos Ecosystem**: Using IBC protocol
3. **Cardano**: Using Native Tokens framework

Each extension would follow a similar pattern of:
1. Native implementation on the target chain
2. Bridge infrastructure development
3. Testing on testnet
4. Mainnet deployment
5. Integration with ecosystem DeFi platforms
